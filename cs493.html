<p>York College: Mission, Vision and Values</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
	<p title="Mission">York College enriches lives and enables students to grow as passionate, engaged learners with the confidence to realize their intellectual and human potential as individuals and global citizens.

	<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>York College's hallmark academic programs in liberal arts and sciences will be recognized as centers of excellence within CUNY, attracting and graduating some of the best and most highly-motivated students from New York City and the greater New York area. We will be the first choice for prospective CUNY students interested in the health professions, allied health sciences, and business, including aviation management. York College will also establish itself as a model for enabling first generation college students to earn an undergraduate degree and will fulfill students' individual academic goals while preparing them for graduate education and the competitive marketplace. Students are at the center of their own learning at York College. We offer multiple opportunities for student engagement, inquiry and research-based scholarship, and experiential learning. York maintains a vibrant campus where students actively participate in extra-curricular programs and collaborate with faculty and academic peers whose backgrounds are distinctly different from their own. The College has a dynamic student life with athletic and visual/performing arts programs, special interest clubs and social organizations where students develop enduring relationships and refine interpersonal skills.</p>
